## [Standardization of a Range of Values]()

It describes the process of scaling or normalizing data within a specific range, typically to a standardized scale, for example, from 0 to 1. This is a common technique in data analysis and machine learning.

<be>

$$X_{normalized} = \frac{X - X_{\min}}{X_{\max} - X_{\min}}$$

<br>

 <p align="center"> [Where]():

 $$X_{\max} - X_{\min} = \text{Amplitude}$$

 <br>

 ###  Formula for Calculating this Normalized Value in Excel.
 
 ```excel
=(A3-MIN(A$3:A$102))/ (MAX(A$3:A$102)-MIN(A$3:A$102))
```
